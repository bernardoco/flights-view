# Flights Visualization
This repository has visualizations and insights to serve as an inspirational and guideline tool using public data from ANAC (National Civil Aviation Agency), 
available [here](https://www.gov.br/anac/pt-br/assuntos/regulados/empresas-aereas/Instrucoes-para-a-elaboracao-e-apresentacao-das-demonstracoes-contabeis/microdados/).

## Getting Started
First, you'll need to download the data using the src/utils/get_data.py file.
```
python src/utils/get_data.py
```

Then, I've created a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook with some visualizations to inspire you.
